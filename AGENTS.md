# Agent Guide Personal Portfolio Website

## Purpose

This project is a **personal portfolio website** built with the flexibility to adapt over time.  
Its current focus is to serve as a professional, modern, and interactive online presence — showcasing work, achievements, and expertise — but it is designed so the content, features, and audience can expand in the future.

The site will initially emphasize professional background, education, certifications, and technical projects, but the structure allows for adding new sections such as services, a blog, or client portals without major architectural changes.
