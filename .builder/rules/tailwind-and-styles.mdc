description: Styling with Tailwind and minimal CSS Modules
alwaysApply: true

Tailwind:
- Import `styles/globals.css` in `app/layout.tsx` and include `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for spacing, layout, color, typography.
- Avoid inline `style` and global CSS for component-specific styling.

CSS Modules:
- If a component needs non-trivial styles, create `Component.module.css`, import locally, and combine with Tailwind classes as needed.

Design:
- Ensure responsive classes (`sm: md: lg:`) for layout components.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible patterns (labels, roles, focus states).
