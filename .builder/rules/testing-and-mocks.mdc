Mock data:
- For every new interface representing API data, create a matching mock in `tests/mockData/`.
- Mocks must conform to the interface and be exported for reuse.

Example:
```ts
// tests/mockData/products.ts
import type { Product } from '@/types/iProduct';
export const sampleProducts: Product[] = [
  { id: 'p1', name: 'Widget', price: 19.99 },
];
```

Components:
- When generating a component that consumes data, reference mocks in examples/stories/tests.
- Keep test IDs (data-testid) on interactive elements that require selection in tests.
